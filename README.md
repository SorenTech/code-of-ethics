# A Code of Ethics for Desingers and Developers

*Background: This code of ethics was inspired by a comment from Kristin Valentine in her interview on the CTRL+CLICK Podcast (August 17, 2017) in which she suggested that the inspiration for a genuine code of ethics for designers and developers might come from the professional ethics code for architects (who are also creative designers and builders). Taking this to heart, we have adapted the AIA's 2017 Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to use appropriate langauge for designers and developers. We have also incorporated parts of the AIGA Code of Ethics, using this both to adapt the langauge of the AIA code to be more design/development appropriate and to add additional concerns not addressed by the AIA code.* 

*This code is not officially recognized by any governing body/organization for Designers or Developers (yet). Therefore, you are free to (a) suggest changes (b) modify this code to your own purposes, or (c) ignore us entirely. Additionally, because there is no authoritive body to adminsiter this code, we have removed language from the AIA codes that suggested disciplinary measures or actions. This code is essentially a voluntary commitment, not a binding document.*

## Preamble

A professional designer or developer adheres to principles of integrity that demonstrate respect for their profession, for colleagues, for clients, for audiences or consumers, and for society as a whole. This Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct states guidelines for the conduct of Designers and Developers in fulfilling those obligations. The Code is arranged in three tiers of statements: Canons, Ethical Standards, and Rules of Conduct:
- Canons are broad principles of conduct.
- Ethical Standards (E.S.) are more specific goals toward which Designers and Developers should aspire in professional performance and behavior.
- Rules of Conduct (Rule) are even more specific guidelines for behavior. Rules of Conduct, in some instances, implement more than one Canon or Ethical Standard.

The Code applies to the professional activities of all classes of Desingers and Developers, wherever they occur. It addresses responsibilities to the public, which the profession serves and enriches; to the clients and users of Design/Development and in the design/software industries, who help to shape our increasingly technological environment; and to the arts and sciences of design and development, that continuum of knowledge and creation which is the heritage and legacy of the profession.

Commentary is provided for some of the Rules of Conduct. That commentary is meant to clarify or elaborate the intent of the rule. The commentary is not part of the Code, it is there to assist those seeking to conform their conduct to the Code.

### Statement in Compliance with Antitrust Law
The following practices are not, in themselves, unethical, unprofessional, or contrary to the Code:
- (1) submitting, at any time, competitive bids or price quotations, including in circumstances where price is the sole or principal consideration in the selection of a designeer or developer;
- (2) providing discounts; or
- (3) providing free services.

Individual designers/developers or design/development firms are free to decide for themselves whether or not to engage in any of these practices. Antitrust law permits designers/developers, their firms, and other associations to which tye belong to advocate legislative or other government policies or actions relating to these practices. Finally, designers and developers should continue to consult with state laws or regulations governing the practice of their profeesions.

*Commentary: To encourage the full and open exchange of information necessary for a successful professional relationship, Designers/Developers must recognize and respect the sensitive nature of confidential client communications. Because the law does not recognize a desinger/developer-client privilege, however, the rule permits a Desinger/Developer to reveal a confidence when a failure to do so would be unlawful or contrary to another ethical duty imposed by this Code.*

**Rule 3.402**
Designers and Developers shall treat all work in progress prior to the completion of a project and all knowledge of a client’s intentions, production methods and business organization as conﬁdential and shall not divulge such information in any manner whatsoever without the consent of the client.

## Canon IV Obligations to the Profession
Designers and Develoers should uphold the integrity and dignity of the profession.

### E.S.4.1 Honesty and Fairness:
Designers and Developers should pursue their professional activities with honesty and fairness.

**Rule 4.101**
Desigers and Developers shall not certify or ship, specifications, reports, code, designs or other professional work for which they do not have responsible control.

*Commentary: Responsible control means the degree of knowledge and supervision ordinarily required by the professional standard of care.

**Rule 4.201**
Designers and Developers shall not make misleading, deceptive, or false statements or claims about their professional qualifications, experience, or performance and shall accurately state the scope and nature of their responsibilities in connection with work for which they are claiming credit.

*Commentary: This rule is meant to prevent Designers/Developers from claiming or implying credit for work which they did not do, misleading others, and denying other participants in a project their proper share of credit. When not the sole author of a work, it is incumbent upon a designer/developer to clearly identify his or her speciﬁc responsibilities or involvement with the work. Examples of such work may not be used for publicity, display or portfolio samples without clear identiﬁcation of precise areas of authorship.*

**Rule 4.202**
Designers and Developers shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that those over whom they have supervisory authority conform their conduct to this Code.

*Commentary: What constitutes “reasonable efforts” under this rule is a common sense matter. As it makes sense to ensure that those over whom the designer/developer exercises supervision be made generally aware of the Code, it can also make sense to bring a particular provision to the attention of a particular employee when a situation is present which might give rise to violation.*
