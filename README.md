# A Code of Ethics for Desingers and Developers

*Background: This code of ethics was inspired by a comment from Kristin Valentine in her interview on the CTRL+CLICK Podcast (August 17, 2017) in which she suggested that the inspiration for a genuine code of ethics for designers and developers might come from the professional ethics code for architects (who are also creative designers and builders). Taking this to heart, we have adapted the AIA's 2017 Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to use appropriate langauge for designers and developers. We intend to also incorporate in parts of the AIGA Code of Ethics. You are free to (a) suggest changes (b) modify this code, or (c) ignore us entirely.*

*A primary change we have had to make to the AIA model we are working from is recognizing that there is no authoritative body with the power to discipline designers or developers. This code is essentially a voluntary commitment, not a binding document.

## Preamble

Designers and Developers are dedicated to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and competence. This Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct states guidelines for the conduct of Designers and Developers in fulfilling those obligations. The Code is arranged in three tiers of statements: Canons, Ethical Standards, and Rules of Conduct:
- Canons are broad principles of conduct.
- Ethical Standards (E.S.) are more specific goals toward which Designers and Developers should aspire in professional performance and behavior.
- Rules of Conduct (Rule) are even more specific guidelines for behavior. Rules of Conduct, in some instances, implement more than one Canon or Ethical Standard.

The Code applies to the professional activities of all classes of Desingers and Developers, wherever they occur. It addresses responsibilities to the public, which the profession serves and enriches; to the clients and users of Design/Development and in the design/software industries, who help to shape our increasingly technological environment; and to the arts and sciences of design and development, that continuum of knowledge and creation which is the heritage and legacy of the profession.

Commentary is provided for some of the Rules of Conduct. That commentary is meant to clarify or elaborate the intent of the rule. The commentary is not part of the Code, it is there to assist those seeking to conform their conduct to the Code.

### Statement in Compliance with Antitrust Law
The following practices are not, in themselves, unethical, unprofessional, or contrary to the Code:
- (1) submitting, at any time, competitive bids or price quotations, including in circumstances where price is the sole or principal consideration in the selection of a designeer or developer;
- (2) providing discounts; or
- (3) providing free services.

Individual designers/developers or design/development firms are free to decide for themselves whether or not to engage in any of these practices. Antitrust law permits designers/developers, their firms, and other associations to which tye belong to advocate legislative or other government policies or actions relating to these practices. Finally, designers and developers should continue to consult with state laws or regulations governing the practice of their profeesions.

## Canon I General Obligations
Designers and Developers should maintain and advance their knowledge of the arts and sciences of design and development, respect the body of design/development accomplishment, contribute to its growth, thoughtfully consider the social and environmental impact of their professional activities, and exercise learned and uncompromised professional judgment.

### E.S.1.1 Knowledge and Skill:
Designers and Developers should strive to improve their professional knowledge and skill.

**Rule 1.101**
In practicing design or development, Designers and Developers shall demonstrate a consistent pattern of reasonable care and competence, and shall apply the technical knowledge and skill which is ordinarily applied by designers and developers of good standing practicing in the same locality.

### E.S.1.2 Standards of Excellence: 
Designers and Developers should continually seek to raise the standards of aesthetic excellence, design/development education, research, training, and practice.

Designers and Developers should respect and help conserve their natural and cultural heritage while striving to improve the technical, cultural, and economic environment and the quality of life within it.

### E.S.1.4 Human Rights: 
Designers and Developers should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors.

**Rule 1.401**
Designers and Developers shall not discriminate in their professional activities on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, or sexual orientation.

### E.S.1.5 Design for Human Dignity and the Health, Safety, and Welfare of the Public: 
Designers and Developers should employ their professional knowledge and skill to design products and applicatons that will enhance and facilitate human dignity and the health, safety, and welfare of the individual and the public.

### E.S. 1.6 Allied Arts and Industries:
Designers and Developers should promote allied arts and contribute to the knowledge and capability of the creative industries as a whole.

## Canon II Obligations to the Public
Designers and Developers should embrace the spirit and letter of the law governing their professional affairs and should promote and serve the public interest in their personal and professional activities.

### E.S. 2.1 Conduct:
Designers and Developers should uphold the law in the conduct of their professional activities.

**Rule 2.101**
Designers and Developers shall not, in the conduct of their professional practice, knowingly violate the law.

**Rule 2.102**
Designers and Developers shall neither offer nor make any payment or gift to a public official with the intent of influencing the official’s judgment in connection with an existing or prospective project in which the Designer/Developer is interested.

*Commentary: This rule does not prohibit campaign contributions made in conformity with applicable campaign financing laws.*

**Rule 2.103**
Designers and Developers serving in a public capacity shall not accept payments or gifts which are intended to influence their judgment.

**Rule 2.104**
Designers and Developers shall not engage in conduct involving fraud or wanton disregard of the rights of others.

*Commentary: This rule addresses serious misconduct whether or not related to a Desinger/Developer's professional practice.*

**Rule 2.105**
If, in the course of their work on a project, the Designer/Developer becomes aware of a decision taken by their employer or client which violates any law or regulation and which will, in the Designer/Developer's judgment, materially affect adversely the safety to the public of the finished project, the Members shall:
- (a) advise their employer or client against the decision,
- (b) refuse to consent to the decision, and
- (c) report the decision to the local official charged with the enforcement of the applicable laws and regulations, unless the Designer/Developer is able to cause the matter to be satisfactorily resolved by other means.

*Commentary: This rule extends only to violations of laws that threaten the public safety and are relevant for the particular work of the Designer/Developer. The obligation under this rule applies only to the safety of the finished project, an obligation coextensive with the usual undertaking of a designer/developer.*

**Rule 2.106**
Designers/Developers shall not counsel or assist a client in conduct that the designer/developer knows, or reasonably should know, is fraudulent or illegal.

### E.S.2.2 Public Interest Services:
Designers and Developers should render public interest professional services, including pro bono services, and encourage their employees to render such services. Pro bono services are those rendered without expecting compensation, including those rendered for indigent persons, after disasters, or in other emergencies.

### E.S. 2.3 Civic Responsibility:
Designers and Developers should be involved in civic activities as citizens and professionals, and should strive to improve public appreciation and understanding of design/development and the functions and responsibilities of designers and developers.

**Rule 2.301**
Designers and Developers making public statements on design/development issues shall disclose when they are being compensated for making such statements or when they have an economic interest in the issue.

## Canon III Obligations to the Client
Designers and Developers should serve their clients competently and in a professional manner, and should exercise unprejudiced and unbiased judgment when performing all professional services.

### E.S. 3.1 Competence:
Designers and Developers should serve their clients in a timely and competent manner.

**Rule 3.101**
In performing professional services, Designers and Developers shall take into account applicable laws and regulations. Designers and Developers may rely on the advice of other qualified persons as to the intent and meaning of such regulations.

**Rule 3.102**
Designers and Developers shall undertake to perform professional services only when they, together with those whom they may engage as consultants, are qualified by education, training, or experience in the specific technical areas involved.

*Commentary: This rule is meant to ensure that Designers/Developers not undertake projects that are beyond their professional capacity. Members venturing into areas that require expertise they do not possess may obtain that expertise by additional education, training, or through the retention of consultants with the necessary expertise.*

**Rule 3.103**
Designers and Developers shall not materially alter the scope or objectives of a project without the client’s consent.

### E.S. 3.2 Conflict of Interest:
Designers and Developers should avoid conflicts of interest in their professional practices and fully disclose all unavoidable conflicts as they arise.

**Rule 3.201**
A Designer or Developer shall not render professional services if the Designer/Developer's professional judgment could be affected by responsibilities to another project or person, or by the Designer/Developer’s own interests, unless all those who rely on the Designer/Developer’s judgment consent after full disclosure.

*Commentary: This rule is intended to embrace the full range of situations that may present a Designer/Developer with a conflict between his interests or responsibilities and the interest of others. Those who are entitled to disclosure may include a client, owner, employer, contractor, or others who rely on or are affected by the Designer/Developer's professional decisions. A Designer/Developer who cannot appropriately communicate about a conflict directly with an affected person must take steps to ensure that disclosure is made by other means.*

**Rule 3.202**
When acting by agreement of the parties as the independent interpreter of contract documents and the judge of contract performance, Designers and Developers shall render decisions impartially.

*Commentary: This rule applies when the Designer/Developer, though paid by the owner and owing the owner loyalty, is nonetheless required to act with impartiality in fulfilling the designer/developer’s professional responsibilities.*

### E.S. 3.3 Candor and Truthfulness:
Designers and Developers should be candid and truthful in their professional communications and keep their clients reasonably informed about the clients’ projects.

**Rule 3.301**
Designers and Developers shall not intentionally or recklessly mislead existing or prospective clients about the results that can be achieved through the use of the Designer/Developer’ services, nor shall the Designer/Developer state that they can achieve results by means that violate applicable law or this Code.

*Commentary: This rule is meant to preclude dishonest, reckless, or illegal representations by a Designer/Developer either in the course of soliciting a client or during performance.*

### E.S. 3.4 Confidentiality:
Designers and Developers should safeguard the trust placed in them by their clients.

**Rule 3.401**
Designers and Developers shall not knowingly disclose information that would adversely affect their client or that they have been asked to maintain in confidence, except as otherwise allowed or required by this Code or applicable law.

*Commentary: To encourage the full and open exchange of information necessary for a successful professional relationship, Designers/Developers must recognize and respect the sensitive nature of confidential client communications. Because the law does not recognize a desinger/developer-client privilege, however, the rule permits a Desinger/Developer to reveal a confidence when a failure to do so would be unlawful or contrary to another ethical duty imposed by this Code.*

## Canon IV Obligations to the Profession
Designers and Develoers should uphold the integrity and dignity of the profession.

### E.S.4.1 Honesty and Fairness:
Designers and Developers should pursue their professional activities with honesty and fairness.

**Rule 4.101**
Desigers and Developers shall not certify or ship, specifications, reports, code, designs or other professional work for which they do not have responsible control.

*Commentary: Responsible control means the degree of knowledge and supervision ordinarily required by the professional standard of care. With respect to the work of consultants, Designers/Developers may certify or ship such work if they have reviewed it, coordinated its preparation, or intend to be responsible for its adequacy.*

**Rule 4.103**
Designers and Developers speaking in their professional capacity shall not knowingly make false statements of material fact.

*Commentary: This rule applies to statements in all professional contexts, including job interviews, conversations with clients, and public presentations.*

### E.S. 4.2 Dignity and Integrity:
Designers and Developers should strive, through their actions, to promote the dignity and integrity of the profession, and to ensure that their representatives and employees conform their conduct to this Code.

**Rule 4.201**
Designers and Developers shall not make misleading, deceptive, or false statements or claims about their professional qualifications, experience, or performance and shall accurately state the scope and nature of their responsibilities in connection with work for which they are claiming credit.

*Commentary: This rule is meant to prevent Designers/Developers from claiming or implying credit for work which they did not do, misleading others, and denying other participants in a project their proper share of credit.*

**Rule 4.202**
Designers and Developers shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that those over whom they have supervisory authority conform their conduct to this Code.

*Commentary: What constitutes “reasonable efforts” under this rule is a common sense matter. As it makes sense to ensure that those over whom the designer/developer exercises supervision be made generally aware of the Code, it can also make sense to bring a particular provision to the attention of a particular employee when a situation is present which might give rise to violation.*

## Canon V Obligations to Colleagues
Designers and Developers should respect the rights and acknowledge the professional aspirations and contributions of their colleagues.

### E.S. 5.1 Professional Environment:
Designers and Developers should provide their associates and employees with a suitable working environment, compensate them fairly, and facilitate their professional development.

### E.S. 5.2 Intern and Professional Development:

**Rule 5.303**
A Designer/Developer shall not unreasonably withhold permission from a departing employee or partner to take copies of designs, code, data, reports, notes, or other materials relating to work performed by the employee or partner that are not confidential.

*Commentary: A Member may impose reasonable conditions, such as the payment of copying costs, on the right of departing persons to take copies of their work.*
